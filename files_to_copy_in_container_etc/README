At installation time, the CMakeLists.txt in this directory generates
and installs the files to be copied into the container's /etc
(e.g. /etc/passwd, /etc/groups, /etc/nsswitch.conf, ...).
Such files are installed in the directory specified by the
CMake variable DIR_OF_FILES_TO_COPY_IN_CONTAINER_ETC.
