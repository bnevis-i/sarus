At installation time, the CMakeLists.txt in this directory generates
and installs the configuration files to be copied into the container's
/etc (e.g. /etc/passwd, /etc/groups, /etc/nsswitch.conf, ...).

These files are needed to setup basic container features,
like information about file owners in shared directories,
or networking with other computing nodes.

These files are installed in the directory specified by the
CMake variable DIR_OF_FILES_TO_COPY_IN_CONTAINER_ETC.
