At installation time, the CMakeLists.txt in this directory generates
and installs the configuration files to be copied into the container's
/etc (e.g. /etc/passwd, /etc/groups, /etc/nsswitch.conf, ...).

These files are needed to setup basic container features,
like information about file owners in shared directories,
or networking with other computing nodes.

These files are installed in the directory ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/files_to_copy_in_container_etc.
